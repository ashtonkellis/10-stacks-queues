## To Submit this Assignment
  * submit a pull request to your forked repository
  * submit a link to your PR in canvas
  * write a question 
  * and observation

#### Testing  
  * write at least two assertions for each method of the Stack and Queue List Data Structures
  * organize your tests into appropriate describe/test blocks for test output readability

#### Feature Tasks  
  * implement a Stack constructor
    * implement `push(value)`, `pop()`, and `peek()` methods on the Stack class by utilizing methods from the Linked List class you already defined in Lab 5, or in your `data-structures-and-algorithms` repo. 
  * implement a Queue constructor
    * implement `enqueue(value)`, `dequeue()`, and `peek()` methods on the Queue class by utilizing methods from the Linked List class you already defined in Lab 5, or in your `data-structures-and-algorithms` repo. 
  
####  Documentation  
List out the methods for your Queue and Stack class and explain what they do by using your favorite analogy for each.
List the Big Oh time and space complexity for each method, making considerations for the actual Big Oh complexity they might have under the hood when utilizing Linked List or Array methods.
